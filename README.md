# sleep_until_or_later


## Overview

Is std library's sleep_for accurate to a microsecond ? Put another way, what should be our expectation of the difference between **expected_count** of miroceconds sleep and **actual_count**. It is required that **actual_count** be equal or greater than **expected_count**. Initial tests showed that ```std::this_thread::sleep_for*```  is accurate to *a millisecond or so*. 

```sleep_until_or_later```  is a *header-only* microsecond accurate alternative to ```std::this_thread::sleep_for```. 

## Design
### Requirements

- OSâ€™s scheduler priority choice can not be altered.
- Runs on the thread it is called on. Does not create any threads. 
- Minimal work above comparable ```std::this_thread::sleep_for```.
- Simple API ```void sleep_until_or_later (unsigned int microseconds)```

### Design approach: Coarse duration & Fine duration
Divide the **expected_count** in to larger coarse and fine duration counts. Use ```std::this_thread::sleep_for``` for coarse_duration, followed by call sleeping through fine_duration be repeated calls to ```::now()```.

*1.  ```Initial_Mark = ::now()```

*2.  ```std::this_thread::sleep_for``` for a ```chunk_count =  expected_count - delta_count```

*3. Calculate  ```remainder_count = ::now() - Initial_Mark``` 

*4. ```Rem_Mark = ::now()```

*5. Initialize ```duration_count = ::now() - Rem_Mark``` 

*6. While ```(duration_count < remainder_count) {duration_count = ::now() - Rem_Mark}``` 


#### Choice of fine_duration count ( microseconds)
Fine_duration count is smaller than expected_count and is set proportional to the expected_count but never larger than 10,000 ( or 10 milliseconds)

## Example
We'll now see how ```sleep_until_or_later```  can be used. The header file can be fetched from the repository. 

```c++
#include "sleep_util_or_later.hpp"

unsigned int in_microsecs = 1234567u;
auto mark = std::chrono::steady_clock ::now ();

sleep_until_or_later(in_microsecs.count);

auto took = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(std::chrono::steady_clock ::now () - mark);
auto time = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::duration<float>>(took);
auto diff = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::duration<float>>(sleep_time - time);

```

## Executable Demo: sleep_until_or_later

### Building
```git clone https://github.com/gmnamra/sleep_until_or_later```
```cd sleep_until_or_later```
```open sleep_until_or_later.xcodeproj```
Set Team and build

### Running
```
$ ./sleep_until_or_later
    sleep_until_or_later is run and performance compared with thisthread::sleep_for
    Usage:  [ optional:-[vV] verbose optional:count <microseconds>
    commandline is empty, runs standard test with verbose set to off
    If count is 0, runs built in test cases
    else sleep_until_or_later is run and performance compared with thisthread::sleep_for
```
```
$ ./sleep_until_or_later -v 10000000
sleep_until_or_later is run and performance compared with thisthread::sleep_for
